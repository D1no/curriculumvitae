# `cv.din.ooo`

This projects renders and generates my cv / resume with various double-blind provision capabilities and access tracking / control functionalities.

## Stack

Based on a self designed `4pt 12 column design system` previously updated in sketchapp; which simply became too tedious.

- `ReactJS` for rendering
- `Emotion/xStyled` for design system / layouting
- `Storybook` for component development
- `React Router` for access control and feature mapping
- `Zustand` for propagated state management
- `Firebase` for cdn-hosting, staging, content management, tracking and access restrictions

## Other

This repository uses my [gitmoji.com](http://gitmoji.com/) commit tagging system.
